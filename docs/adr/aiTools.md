## What AI tools i used and how it supported my process

For this task, alongside researching some questions online, I primarily used ChatGBT (free version) as a supportive tool. I treat it more like a technical companion than a source of final answers.

I tend to find ChatGBT like a very agreeable colleague. It tends to agree with most of my solutions/ideas and does not give alternative suggestions. So it does not prevent me from critical thinking and trying to expand on ideas by myself.

For example, when I ask a ChatGBT for help. It proposes a solution, I think about this, come up with other ideas/possibilities, challenge its suggestions and work iteratively that way. I find it is wrong sometimes, so I use it more like a tool to help me complete things faster.

For me, ChatGBT is especially helpful for repetitive tasks. It helps speed up tasks such as code checking and cleaning up documentation for grammar/spelling. This is particularly useful when working under time constraints, for example when I am writing up an idea quickly.

Overall I would say I use ChatGBT with caution. It is like an assistant who is good technically, but is not in the driving seat and has no control over decision making.

When I have more time on a project, I tend to use it less. However when time is limited, it becomes a useful way to move faster while still maintaining control and quality.
